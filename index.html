	<h1> So I like Fighting Games...</h1>

	<p>Started trying them out near the early stages of Covid. Dug up some old games and some old consoles, and saw that my dad had a bunch of stuff. Capcom vs SNK 2, Capcom Evoltion, Street Fighter 4, I even found some downloaded games on his old xbox account, like Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 and DragonBall FighterZ.</p>

	<h2>It's a process...</h2>

	<p> I never understood the controls back when I first tried them out when I was little, but trying therm then , it was fun. Learning about the crazy ways the buttons are set up, figuring out the different genres and mechanics. Plus it introduced me to a lot of new characters and franchies, it was like I had found a gold mine of just new stuff for me to learn and discover.</p>

	<p> And for me to discover this during the quarantine, couldn't have come at a better time for me.</p>

	<h2> Not any good, but can't stop playing</h2>
	<p> I've played a lot since then, tried out the different Street Fighters, a couple of the Mortal Combats, tried my hand in some other franchises like Guilty Gear, the Persona Areana games. Motion inputs, tag team games, some older sprite games, lots of stuff. Gotten my ass handed to me quite a few times, but I can easily see the improvement I've made compared to now and when I started.</p>

	<p> Currently excited to try my hand in the new Tekken 8 game that came out. Tons of moves, characters I know nothing about, haven't tried a 3D fighter like it, I'm tellin ya, fighting games never get old. Relearning a whole new thing, and I'm loving every second of it.</p>
